# autoclasslogin
helps smart students like us to log into class

initially keep the xlsx file which contains the class id in the same folder as autoclassloogin

run the setup.sh to initially log you into class and extract the class id's into a json file

now you just need to provide which class you would like to join , as a command line argument

ex. if i have to login into 3rd class

python3 app.py 3
